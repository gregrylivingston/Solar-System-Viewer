Needs objects for


player - stores player name, $$, maybe references to owned objects etc.

permanent map states - what actually gets stored - let's store it and call it back later.





buttons can be clicked but shouldnt they have subTypes (like up/down iterator, slide, that kind of thing?)


How to wrap up this solar system experience quickly so I can go on to the second, more functional version of this program.

---- Science just becomes a list of things to explore!
---- Finish descriptions for moons, planets, and tilesets
---- abstract icon sets (right now just tiles and icons) - these are object sets and NOT art sets.  They are just definitions for objects though.  So shouldn't those objects get created in the game instead of ever in the engine?
---- mask out unused buttons
---- clean up top panel
---- improve mouse down rules for scrolling
---- improve scrolling contextual rules



Some thoughts on engine

---adding video and images would be cool
---should there be a foreground canvas AND a background canvasssssss
--- can html elemnts be layered with this, is that worth working on?
